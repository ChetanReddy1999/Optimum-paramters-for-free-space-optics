# Optimum-paramters-for-free-space-optics
Free space optics basically rely on some real time parameters like laser power,aperture based on the research done these parameters are taken into account for better bit error rate.
This project is simulation based free space optics project.

1)Basically free space optics are cost effective for smaller regions but suffers lot of attenuation.

2)But based on the research done with my friends we came to a conclusion that some optical parameters can be changed according to the changes in the atmosphere for bit error
rate of 1e-9.


Free space optics based on WDM system suffers from various
limitations, especially atmospheric turbulence due to the weather and
environment structure . Atmospheric attenuation of FSO system is
typically dominated by haze and fog, but is also dependent upon rain
and dust. The total attenuation is a combination of atmospheric
attenuation and geometric losses. Scattering produced by atmospheric
particles can be considered as a form of dispersion of the energy that
makes the signal divert from its original target. Geometrical scattering is
the result of raindrops and snow that are made of larger molecules
having an impact similar to Raleigh scattering. Turbulence is the random
fluctuation in the refraction index of air produced by differential heating
and has the effect of defocusing the beam, producing intensity
fluctuations in the received signal (scintillation), and contributing to the
spreading of the transmitted beam. Turbulence is partially compensated
by tracking and adaptive optics techniques, and it has a greater impact 
on higher frequencies within the near infrared sub-band (1550 nm is
therefore, less affected) .
